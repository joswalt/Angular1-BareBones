# Angular 1.X Bare Bones Project

The Bare Bones project is an Angular starter project that has the npm modules, 
configuration, scripts, folders and routing in place to make getting started 
with an Angular 1 project easy!

Here's what is in the project:

* Angular scripts and configuration are ready to go
* Angular bootstrapper wired up to the app module
* App shell with basic routing applied
* Utilized angular-ui-router for routing in application
* Modular based application design to help with team development per feature
* Dashboard module for initial layout 
* A single "feature" component (represents a custom feature your app would have)
* A simple data service to provide data and show dependency injection
* Routing between the homepage and the "feature"
* Bootstrap for CSS
* live-server used to launch the site and reload it as you make changes

It's a minimal app intended to get you up and running quickly so the rest is up to you!
